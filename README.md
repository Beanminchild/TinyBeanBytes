Tiny Javascript/html games i made for my nieces. These games are great for kids ages 2+

Feel free to look at these for examples on how to make tiny games using html javascript and css

The reason im using raw html like this is the free service im using to host the website is quite limited so i have to keep the file sizes really small and cant have them call to other files too much for risk of exceting my file usage limit

## How to Play
Either go to https://Tinybeanbytes.free.nf or download the files and open the games in any browser :)
